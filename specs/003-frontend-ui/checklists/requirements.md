# Specification Quality Checklist: Frontend Application – High-Level Todo App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - Note: Next.js, TailwindCSS mentioned as explicit constraints from user input
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED** - Specification is ready for planning phase

## Notes

- Specification follows user story prioritization (P1, P2, P3)
- Each user story is independently testable
- Technologies mentioned (Next.js, TailwindCSS) are explicit constraints from user
- Builds on existing Spec 001 (Backend) and Spec 002 (Authentication)
- Ready to proceed to /sp.plan phase
